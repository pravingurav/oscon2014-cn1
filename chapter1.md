#Codename One

Codename One is a library and toolkit for developing native mobile applications.  It currently supports Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and J2ME, but it could potentially be expanded to support any mobile OS.

It includes a java class library and a resource editor application for desiging user interfaces, themes, and managing other application resources.

## What do we mean by "native"

Though your code is written in Java, all code is ultimately compiled down to native machine code.
